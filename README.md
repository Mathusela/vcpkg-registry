# Versioning

Despite the warning from the vcpkg registries [documentation page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/maintainers/registries): "One very important part of registries is that versions should never be changed. Updating to a later ref should never remove or change an existing version. It must always be safe to update a registry.", we consider major version 0.x.y of a package to be for initial-development and therefore subject to modification or removal after publishing - **major version 0.x.y should not be considered stable**.
